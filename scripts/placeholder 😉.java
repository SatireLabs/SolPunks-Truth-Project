# Punks Datasets & Images
**DATASETS**
1. CryptoPunks - All 10,000 in 24x24 (native).
2. CryptoPunks - All 10,000 in 420x420 (scaled). 
4. SolPunks ("Dumb") - Real SolPunks with "Dumb" written.
3. SolPunks (Real) - All 10,000 in 420x420 (native).
1. SolPunks (Fake, Tractor's) - All 10,000 in 256x256 (native).


**TODAY (October 1, 2021), we are declassifying the world's largest Punks database. Free for the public domain.**
You can explore the data by cloning/forking this repo. But also dive right in on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/solpunks/datasets).

We want the world's top data scientists & AI researchers to use advanced butt analysis and anal clustering techniques to understand the nature of Tractor's Fake SolPunks.
Can you tell they're not real SolPunks?
If you look closely and hard enough, they all look eerily similar to Mario's bum.

We know that Tractor directly copied from CryptoPunks. So maybe do some cross-butt analysis to determine key features of Tractor's SolPunks.

We also released images of all 10,000 REAL "Dumb" SolPunks. So you can see what greatness looks like ðŸ˜Ž. And so you can see they're not butts.

# FIND YOUR PERFECT "DUMB"
**DON'T LET SOLPUNKS GET DISCOVERED. Help keep crypto & NFT pure and sacred.**
We donâ€™t expect most people to YOLO their life savings into Dumb SolPunks (despite their long-term value being 100K SOL each).

But consider making your profile picture a Dumb SolPunk.

A "dumb" pic the perfect way to
- Demonstrate your high IQ and humbleness.
- Show you're not afraid of Tractor's pathetic crap (read: [SolPunks & Trademark](https://satirelabs.medium.com/someone-is-trying-to-trademark-cryptopunks-and-its-not-larva-labs-dab0a46e6432))
- Support SolPunks (who saved humanity 3 times), by helping them blend into the crowd.

Dumb SolPunks look great on Twitter, Instagram, and as company profile pics. And they will help obfuscate our presence as Tractor becomes more pathetic and gives ominous threats of "shutting us down".
